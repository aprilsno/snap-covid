# SNAP Participation During the COVID-19 Pandemic

This project was completed for BST260 (Data Science I) at Harvard T.H. Chan in Fall 2023. The aim of this project was to assess the association between COVID-19 cases and food insecurity on a county-level in the U.S. A secondary aim was to consider how SNAP participation, poverty, and income influence the relationship between COVID-19 cases and food insecurity. These aims were motivated by initial exploratory analyses that revealed a positive linear trend between COIVD-19 case rates and food insecurity rates. Leveraging county-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USDA, Feeding America, and U.S. Census Bureau, this project visualized the associations of interest in a series of time trends, summary plots, and regression models.
